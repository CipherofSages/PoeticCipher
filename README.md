# PoeticCipher 2023
-------------------
Connects the worlds of poetry and coding
-------------------

PoeticCipher is a Python library for Torah Study encoding and decoding Bible verses through atbash, gematria, and ESL. The acronym ELS stands for Equidistant Letter Sequencing. 

We will continue to work on this project as we study (ESL) and other codes.
